# Grocery_Tracking_Program
CS 210 Project Three

#Summarize the project and what problem it was solving:

The GroceryTracker project is a program designed to help users manage and track their grocery items efficiently.

#What did you do particularly well?

This project provide a user-friendly interface through the console menu, allowing users to interact with the program easily.

#Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?

An area where I see room for improvement is how the program manages file operations. By incorporating exceptions to handle situations where files can't be opened or written, the program could offer more informative error messages. 

#Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?

The most challenging part was developing the histogram display in the printHistogram function. Hoever, with determination and online research, I successfully completed it. 

#What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?

I learned file reading and writing, organized data with maps, separated tasks, and focused on user-friendliness.

#How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

To keep the program easy to manage, I separated tasks into different parts and added a way to deal with errors.
